# Latent Feature Extraction in Pneumonia X-Ray Images Using Autoencoders with Keras

This GitHub project, implemented on the Keras framework, focuses on autoencoder and denoising autoencoder models applied to pneumonia X-Ray images from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) Kaggle dataset. 

The primary goal is to efficiently extract meaningful image latent features.
